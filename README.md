**Task 1: Understanding Dataset & Data Types
 Objective**

The objective of this task is to understand the structure of datasets, identify different data types, analyze data quality, and evaluate the suitability of datasets for machine learning before building any models.

**Datasets Used**

Titanic Dataset (titanic.xls)

Passenger details used to predict survival

Student Performance Dataset (student_performance.csv)

Academic and behavioral data used to analyze student performance

**Tools & Technologies**

Python

Pandas

NumPy

Jupyter Notebook (Anaconda)


**Steps Performed**

Loaded both datasets using Pandas.

Displayed first and last few records to understand structure.

Identified numerical, categorical, ordinal, and binary features.

Used df.info() and df.describe() to analyze data types, missing values, and statistics.

Checked unique values in categorical columns to understand data distribution.

Identified target variables and input features for machine learning.

Analyzed dataset size and evaluated ML suitability.

Documented data quality issues such as missing values and class imbalance.

** Key Observations**

Titanic dataset contains missing values and class imbalance, requiring preprocessing.

Student Performance dataset is clean and well-structured.

Both datasets are suitable for machine learning with appropriate preprocessing.

Understanding data before modeling helps in selecting the right algorithms and improves performance.

** Outcome**

This task helped in gaining a clear understanding of:

Dataset structure

Data types

Data quality issues

Machine learning readiness
